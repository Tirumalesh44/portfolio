  about: `Hello! I'm Tirumalesh Naidu Vanjarapu, a passionate and curious technology enthusiast currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering. With a strong foundation in programming and a deep interest in solving real-world problems through innovation, I’ve gained hands-on experience across a broad spectrum of technologies, from full-stack development to machine learning and data analysis.
  collaborative teamwork in a professional setting.

  Outside of tech, I'm a South-Zone level table tennis player, selected for the Inter-University AU team. This competitive background has strengthened my leadership, discipline, and team coordination skills—traits that I bring into every project I work on.
