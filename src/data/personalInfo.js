  about: `I’m Vanjarapu Tirumalesh Naidu, a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering student at GVP College of Engineering, Visakhapatnam, with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in full-stack development. My core strengths lie in building scalable web applications using the MERN stack, with a focus on creating seamless user experiences and efficient backend integrations.

I’ve developed projects like DineFinder, an AI-powered restaurant search platform, and an Alumni-Student Connect portal for networking and mentorship, showcasing my ability to integrate modern technologies like geolocation APIs, JWT authentication, and responsive front-end frameworks. My portfolio site itself reflects my attention to detail and design aesthetics.

Beyond coding, I actively participate in team activities — I proudly led our college table tennis team to a runner-up position in the AU Men’s Championship and represented the South Zone in a national-level event. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and aim to contribute meaningfully to the tech community through impactful and user-centric solutions..
